This is an archival repo for relics from my technological past.

## Apple ][+ version of Conway's cellular automata game of Life

This works very well with the [AppleWin](https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin) emulator; download
[LIFE.DSK](AppleII/LIFE.DSK), load it into drive 1, and run!  High school age me did a staggeringly
good job providing instructions.  Ignore the business about the TASC version and `BLOAD RUNTIME` --
that doesn't seem to be correct anymore.  But the final instructions to `RUN LIFE (HGR) SETUP` are
legit and still work.  I recommend this pattern:
```
**
.**
.*
DONE
```
That's the famous "R pentomino" and it keeps going and going :-)
